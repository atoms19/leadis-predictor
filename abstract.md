# Abstract

## Background
Early identification of learning and developmental difficulties is essential for timely intervention, yet many existing screening and assessment methods are clinic-based, time-consuming, and limited to single modalities. These constraints often delay support and fail to capture a child’s real-world learning behavior, attention patterns, sensory preferences, and motor responses. There is a need for an accessible, child-friendly, and multimodal screening system that can support parents and professionals in identifying early risk indicators for learning and developmental differences.

## Objective
This work proposes an AI-assisted, interactive developmental screening platform designed to identify early risk indicators associated with learning and developmental difficulties in children. The system focuses on risk profiling rather than diagnosis, aiming to evaluate multiple developmental domains—including language, attention, memory, motor coordination, visual processing, and sensory learning preferences—through adaptive interaction and behavioral analysis.

## System Flow and Methods
The screening process begins with structured parent input, where caregivers provide the child’s age, medical and developmental history, family history of learning difficulties, and observed behaviors such as clumsiness, attention challenges, or speech concerns. Based on this information, an age-based adaptive screening path is generated.

Children then engage in an interactive, gamified assessment consisting of categorized multiple-choice questions and mini-games. Questions are presented using text, optional text-to-speech, or combined modalities. The system continuously monitors behavioral signals such as response accuracy, response time, attention consistency, task persistence, and reliance on auditory versus visual prompts to infer learning preferences.

Mini-games are interleaved to assess visual processing, working memory, pattern recognition, and memory retention. Instruction-following tasks are delivered via audio or text and verified using camera-based pose estimation to evaluate comprehension, motor planning, and coordination. Speech-to-text analysis is employed to examine expressive language features, including vocabulary usage, fluency, and pronunciation patterns. Parents may also upload reading materials, allowing analysis of reading interaction patterns that may indicate dyslexia-related features.

All collected multimodal data are processed through a feature extraction layer and mapped to structured developmental domains using rule-based and probabilistic scoring models.

## Results
The system produces an interpretable, domain-based developmental risk profile, categorizing indicators as low, moderate, or high risk across areas such as reading, writing, attention regulation, motor coordination, and memory. Results are presented in a parent-friendly report highlighting strengths, areas of concern, observed behavioral patterns, and inferred learning preferences. The platform emphasizes transparency and explainability, avoiding categorical diagnostic labels.

## Conclusion
This project presents a scalable, ethical, and multimodal AI-based approach to early developmental screening. By integrating parent observations, child interaction data, passive behavioral monitoring, and adaptive assessment techniques, the system aims to support early identification of learning-related risk patterns and facilitate timely referral for professional evaluation. Such an approach has the potential to improve access to early screening, reduce delays in intervention, and empower families with actionable developmental insights.
